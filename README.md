An opiniated photo management app for minimalists.

Based on my ideals wrt photo storage and management, I came up with this tool (and related scripts).
You may or may not agree with them.  Here we go..


## Photo storage & workflow ideology.

I like plain simple directories of pictures. I like directories of pictures which I can upload to my albums online, or directories of pictures
to stream to my TV (not necessarily the same ones, organised the same way, and not neccesarily the same resolution), and I want to keep a copy of pictures exactly the way they came from my devices (to that syncing is trivial).
But I want minimal amount of manual hassle, and minimal redundancy.

I want to have alternative versions of certain images, without polluting my "source" directories, and the ability to select which version
of an image goes into which album(s).

I want to be able to add metadata to pictures, but without modifying the pictures themselves, and in a simple, open format.
Any picture should be able to appear in 0, 1 or more photo albums (or more generally "exported directories"), without copying files.

I want software that makes this easier, but doesn't hide anything from me.
The process should be transparant and only be a thin layer over standard filesytme structures.


## Photo management workflow assumptions.


* You have one or more directories that contain the pictures you pull from your devices or friends, and the directories remain untouched
  (other than the occasional sync to bring it up to date).  No renames, file modifications, or deletes that don't have corresponding deletes on the device.  This allows for trivial syncing/backups.
* any modifications done to pictures are saved in files in a separate directory.
* You assign tags to pictures based on their contents or desired goal (i.e. whether it should go in a certain album or not).
  Pixie makes this as quick and easy as possible.
* Exported directories (for photo albums for uploading or streaming to media) are generated by looking for files with certain tags in the aforementioned source directories.   They can be erased and regenerated at any point.  They merely contain symlinks to the originals

It is conceivable that with the advent of new technology some of these things may change, however a simple file layout
that works on all posix file systems is very valuable (i.e. just directories, files and symlinks).

## dependencies

* tmsu tag database
* golang (for building)

## getting started 

* create a tmsu database
* store into a directory thumbnailed versions of the pictures in the source directories you want to load. 
  a great way to do this is using [gothum](https://github.com/Dieterbe/gothum)
* update config.ini to point to the db and thumbnail directory
* configure keyboard shortcuts in partials/photos.html
* `go run pixie.go`, load `http://localhost:8080` in browser, load a source dir and go for it

## TODO

* when on a picture in pixie UI, allowing to open an editor & saving modified version in other dir.  Also, in the UI, showing the alternative options
  for an image.
* using multiple directories in the UI at the same time (e.g. if you have pics of the same thing taken with different camera's),
  by sorting and merging the image lists by time, you can more easily select the best ones.
* a way to have "mirror directories", of files smaller than the originals, but bigger than thumbnails; so that export directories can
  point to those files.  (this also means that not every file should have be mirrored, only the ones which are used)
